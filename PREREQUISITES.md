# Prerequisites

## Technical Knowledge Required

### Python Programming
You should be comfortable with:
- Functions and classes
- Dictionaries, lists, and data structures
- File I/O operations
- Basic error handling (try/except)

**Test yourself**: Can you write a function that processes a list of dictionaries and returns filtered results? If yes, you're ready.

### Jupyter Notebooks
You should understand:
- Cell execution order
- Markdown vs code cells
- Variable persistence across cells
- Installing packages with pip

### API Concepts
You should know:
- What an API key is and why it's sensitive
- HTTP requests (GET, POST)
- JSON data format
- Rate limits and quotas

**No prior LangChain or agent experience required** - we teach this from scratch.

## Required Accounts

### 1. Google Account
- For Google Colab access
- Free tier is sufficient
- Sign up: https://accounts.google.com/signup

### 2. Anthropic Account (Claude API)
- Required for all examples and homework
- Get API key: https://console.anthropic.com
- See [setup/01_claude_api_setup.md](setup/01_claude_api_setup.md) for detailed instructions

**Cost estimate**: $10-20 for all homework assignments (instructor covers live session costs)

### 3. GitHub Account
- To access course materials
- To submit final project (optional)
- Sign up: https://github.com/signup

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Specifications
- Any computer with modern web browser
- Stable internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps)
- Google Colab provides all compute resources

### Recommended Setup
- Second monitor (to follow along while instructor demonstrates)
- Headset or headphones (for clear audio during live sessions)

## Software Installation

**Nothing to install locally** - all code runs in Google Colab.

However, you should:
1. Test Google Colab access: https://colab.research.google.com
2. Verify you can create and run notebooks
3. Complete [setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb](setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb) before Day 1

## Time Commitment

### Live Sessions
- 6 hours total (3 days x 2 hours each)
- Attendance recommended for all sessions
- Recordings not provided (live interaction is essential)

### Homework
- Chapter 1: 2 hours
- Chapter 2: 2.5 hours
- Chapter 3: 3 hours
- Chapter 4: 2.5 hours
- **Total homework**: ~10 hours

### Final Project
- Research and audit: 2 hours
- Implementation: 3-4 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- **Total project**: 6-7 hours

**Grand total**: ~22-23 hours including live sessions

## Pre-Course Checklist

Complete before Day 1:

- [ ] Verify Python knowledge with self-assessment above
- [ ] Create Google account (if needed)
- [ ] Create Anthropic account and get API key
- [ ] Review [setup/01_claude_api_setup.md](setup/01_claude_api_setup.md)
- [ ] Test Google Colab access
- [ ] Run [setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb](setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb)
- [ ] Read [resources/cheat_sheets/langchain_agents_quickref.md](resources/cheat_sheets/langchain_agents_quickref.md)

## Not Required (But Helpful)

These will enhance your experience but aren't mandatory:

- LangSmith account (for advanced tracing)
- Previous LangChain experience
- Docker knowledge
- Production ML deployment experience

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether you meet the prerequisites:
1. Try running [setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb](setup/04_verify_setup.ipynb)
2. Email the instructor: javier@jmarin.info
3. Review the [resources/reading_list.md](resources/reading_list.md) for background materials

**Better to ask before the course starts than struggle during live sessions.**
