## Course Overview


Companies deploying agentic AI systems face systematic challenges: unpredictable costs, inexplicable failures, and regulatory compliance requirements. This masterclass provides practical frameworks for diagnosing agent failures, implementing observability infrastructure, and building hybrid architectures that combine LLM flexibility with deterministic reliability.

### What You Will Learn

**Chapter 1: Diagnosing Agent Failures**
- Identify temporal coordination breakdowns in multi-agent systems
- Diagnose cost explosion patterns and API waste
- Understand prompt brittleness and failure modes

**Chapter 2: Observability & Telemetry**
- Implement LangChain callbacks and tracing
- Build cost tracking dashboards
- Detect failure patterns automatically

**Chapter 3: Crystallizing Deterministic Workflows**
- Extract neural patterns into symbolic code
- Achieve 20x cost reductions through workflow optimization
- Decide when to use LLMs vs programmatic logic

**Chapter 4: Production-Ready Hybrid Systems**
- Design hybrid architectures (LLM + rules)
- Build validation rubrics for continuous improvement
- Prepare systems for EU AI Act compliance

## Using This Repository

### For Live Sessions
During live sessions, the instructor will demonstrate examples using their own Claude API key. Students follow along without needing their API key active.

### For Homework and Practice
Students use their own Claude API key to complete homework assignments and experiments. See [setup/03_colab_configuration.md](setup/03_colab_configuration.md) for instructions on managing API keys securely in Google Colab.

### Google Colab Integration
All notebooks are designed for Google Colab. To open any notebook in Colab:

1. Navigate to the notebook file on GitHub
2. Copy the URL
3. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
4. Select "GitHub" tab and paste the URL

Alternatively, click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of each notebook.

## Final Project

Students will audit and redesign an existing agentic system (either their own production system or a provided case study). The final project demonstrates:

- Systematic diagnosis of failure modes
- Implementation of observability infrastructure
- Cost optimization through workflow crystallization
- Compliance-ready documentation

See [final_project/project_brief.md](final_project/project_brief.md) for complete requirements.
