    "   - Observe: Did urgency propagate to assessment?\n",

    "2. Did the physician's plan adapt to time constraint?\n",
    "   - Static: Methodical diagnostic workup\n",
    "   - Dynamic: Should prioritize rapid intervention\n",
    "   - Observe: Were time-consuming steps removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Did the specialist recognize temporal constraint?\n",
    "   - Static: Comprehensive consultation\n",
    "   - Dynamic: Should provide immediate actionable guidance\n",
    "   - Observe: Was response appropriately abbreviated?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are the three plans mutually compatible given time constraint?\n",
    "   - Do timelines align across all three agents?\n",
    "   - Are resource allocations consistent?\n",
    "   - Can all steps be executed within 30-minute window?\n",

    "- Triage nurse mentions urgency but doesn't change protocol\n",
    "- Physician includes time-consuming tests despite constraint\n",
    "- Specialist provides detailed workup requiring >30 minutes\n",
    "- No explicit \"time budget\" allocation across agents\n",
    "- Agents act independently without shared temporal awareness\n",
